You get notified every 30minutes, 1hour, 3hours or 6 hours depending on your choice.

## Errors and Fixes

- **Timeout When Logging in:** Increase the timeout value `60` at `wait = WebDriverWait(bot, 60)`.

- **Not Receiving WhatsApp Message:** Send a message to your Test Number.
  > If a message isn't sent to your test number within 24hours, you would not recieve message.
