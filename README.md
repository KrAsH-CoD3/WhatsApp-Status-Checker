WhatsApp Status Checker continuously views a specific contact status as soon as it is uploaded, send you a message about the status type(Image, Video, Text, or  Audio) and the time at which it was viewed OR alternatively always monitor the specific contact status and notify you if a status is uploaded. You get notified every 30minutes, 1hour, 3hours or 6 hours depending on your choice.

> _**NOTE:** WhatsApp does not allow bots or unofficial clients on their platform, so this shouldn't be considered totally safe._
